Here's some info on this readme.  Some stuff here

#Is this big font?


Have naming convensions for...
Standard versus custom reports
How do we solve the problem where a report has to be linked to a specific version?  We'd have to have new and old versions listed.
OR.... we'd have the ability to specify which version of the report is used from inside the report definition?
Inside the new version of the report we'd specify a commit that links to an older version of the report?  When the refresh happens it would be smart enough to know to follow the link backward and load that report?

We could have part of the name be the lowest version of the report allowed?
